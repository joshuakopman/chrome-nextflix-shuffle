# chrome-nextflix-shuffle

Chrome extension that randomizes Netflix episode selection:
- On TV show title-page load (when shuffle is enabled), it picks a random season and episode.
- In the web player, when **Next Episode** is clicked or auto-next occurs at episode end, it routes back through the same random season+episode flow.

## Load locally
